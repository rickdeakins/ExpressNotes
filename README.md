## Usage
As a user I want to be able to document and store my notes in order to stay organized in my daily life. I want to be able to give my note a title and store further details in the body.

## Contributing
The project required the developer to utilize existing code and complete the project with additional development which consisted of connecting and adding additional logic to a variety of previously created functions. Upon an intial deployment roadblock I had consulted Cody Wenrich-Clegg for assistance with review of some errors generated via Heroku. The project is now functioning as intended.

## Tests
The project was tested between both Insomnia as well as Google Chrome, the latter which the Devtools were  utilized to determine where to locate the initial erriors during the debuging process.

## Questions
The parameters of this project specified the necessity to view and add addtional notes to the application, which utilized GET and POST routes. While I have not yet implemented the delete function, this will be a future development that will be completed in the future.
