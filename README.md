## Contributing
This project originated with front end application starter code and many finished portions of code that were pending additional back end support. 

From a developmental standpoint, the application was able to reach complete functionality when the API and html endpoints were routed correctly, the necessary NPM packages were installed as well as the use of a helper file for the process to come together completely. At the time of deployment, the final project is a functioning note taking application.

## Tests
During the backend development process the port was tested in both Insomnia and Chrome, The devtools in Chrome were used to review Javascript errors as well as server errors. Usage of the Nodemon NPM package allowed the application to update in real time as changes were made to the application.

## Final Comments
The current functioning status of this application allows a user to add their notes to the dashboard. As a future development there will be  an additional function to delete notes from the dashboard as well, The clean UI should allow for an optimal user experience with all moving parts working as intended on the backend.
